# simplecalbudget

SimpleCalBudget is a prototype budget in very early development, not close to being functional. Building this for learning and fun. It will be a full-fledged app to keep track of your budget along with being fully open source. This is a single user database app for now, but will expand into a multi-user app later.


# Feature Roadmap
- Budget multiple bank accounts.
- Support for multiple users.
- Local (sqlite3) or remote mysql database.
